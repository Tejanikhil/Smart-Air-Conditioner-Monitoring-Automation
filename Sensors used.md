This project uses an Arduino UNO micro controller. 
Arduino UNO R3 micro controller is based on microchip 
technology ATmega328p 8-bit microcontroller (MCU). 
ATmega328p is a high performance, low power AVR¬Æ 8-
bit microcontroller with 32K bytes of Flash Programmable 
and 1kbytes of erasable read only memory (EEPEROM), 
14 digital I/O pins including the serial pins, 6 analog i/o 
pins, two 8-bit and one 16-bit Timer/Counter, a 16MHz 
quartz crystal (Oscillator). Arduino UNO works under an 
operating voltage of 1.8v to 5.5v in a temperature range of 
‚àí40‡Ø¢ùëê to 85‡Ø¢ùëê. <br />

## Pressure Sensor - 500PSI:

A pressure gauge transducer was selected which has an 
input voltage of 5volts, It can measure up to 500PSI. The 
valve of the pressure transducer can be connected to the 
compressor valve which in turn measures the pressure 
exerted by the refrigerant which can determine the rate of 
flow of refrigerant over a particular area of cross section 
using which one can switch the compressor on or off. <br />

## PIR sensor (HC-SR501):

PIR Sensor series HC-SR501 was selected. For most of the 
application this sensor requires an input voltage of +5v but 
in general it can resist up to a maximum of 12volts. PIR 
sensor is used for detection of moment by differing the 
sensitivity of sensing the movement, It is capable of 
distinguishing object movement and human movement. It 
has a measuring range of 120 degrees and 7 meters. It 
operates at a temperature of ‚àí20‡Ø¢ùëê to 80‡Ø¢ùëê.  <br />

## Temperature and humidity sensor:

Temperature and Humidity Sensor Series DHT22 was 
selected. It requires an input voltage of 3.5v to 5.5v. It can 
measure temperature from -40 to 80C with an accuracy of 
0.5 and measures percentage of relative humidity from 0-
100% in the atmosphere with an accuracy of 1%. Its 
uniqueness is providing digital data by using only one 
digital signal connecting to microcontroller. (Serial data, 
Bi-Directional)  <br />

## Bluetooth (HC-05):

For wireless communication like setting the reference 
temperature and switching the air conditioner, Bluetooth 
HC-05 module was selected. HC-05 module requires a 
minimum of 3.3 volts as input voltage and can tolerate up 
to 5volts. HC-05 module is based on BC417 Single Chip 
Bluetooth IC that is compliant with Bluetooth v2.0 standard 
and with support for both UART and USB interfaces. In 
general HC-05 module will have 6 pins out of which we 
have used only 4 pins.
